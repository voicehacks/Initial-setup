## Summary
This will take you through the steps of configuring your skill in the developer portal. 

### Configure your skill in the developer portal
1. First, login to the [Amazon developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html).  If you haven't done so already, just create a free account.
1. From the top navigation bar, select **Alexa**
1. On the icon labeled **Alexa Skills Kit**, click **Get Started**
1. Select add a new skill
1. Choose a name for your skill. We recommend naming this something similar to your Lambda Function name, though it's not required.
1. Create an invocation phrase. We recommend using a simple one- or two-word phrase that makes sense for your skill. A user will utter the phrase "Alexa, open {your invocation phrase}." to begin the skill.  In the example here, Alexa is the wake word, open is the launch phrase, and whatever you create here will be the invocation name or phrase. [Here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/supported-phrases-to-begin-a-conversation) you can find more info on how users invoke custom skills.
